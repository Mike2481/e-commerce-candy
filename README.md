## Installation

Begin by entering the MySQL shell and running 'source db/schema.sql'. Once that is complete, quit the shell and type 'npm run seed' in the terminal.  Next, you will want to start the server by typing 'npm start' in the terminal.  Finally, you'll want to go to insomnia to test all the endpoints and functionality

## Usage

This back end can be used to show all categories, products, and tags.  It can also POST(create), PUT(update), and DELETE(destroy) all of those things as well.  See it in action [HERE](https://youtu.be/6v388-wz-6M)
